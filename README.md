# Next.js Events

Fullstack application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, MongoDB and deployed on Vercel.

## üóÑÔ∏è Environment Variables

[Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#) are key-value pairs configured outside your source code so that each value can change depending on the Environment.

In this project, you need to set the following environment variables:

```
DB_URL
API_URL
```

`DB_URL` is the URL of the MongoDB database, and `API_URL` is the URL of the Firebase Realtime Database.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## üöÄ Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
